I'm one of them. Then came Facebook, people were crazy about\nhow connected they are on a social network, Facebook solved issues from the\nprevious platforms such as image hosting, messaging, commenting, notification\nand friend list. The &quot;real&quot; social in my country improved a lot with the coming\nof Facebook, people's opinion raised and listened, there was some freedom of\nspeech for a country needed it. I personally felt missing Yahoo! 360 age, where\nwe could share more personal things and wrote our though deeply.</p>\n<p>Since then, I created a blog on Blogger, but I never felt comfortable on that\nplatform, it could be my fault.</p>\n<p>I recently found these guys (<a href=\"https://www.tbray.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Tim Bray</a>,\n<a href=\"https://overreacted.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Dan Abramov</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jwz.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Jamie Zawinski</a>)\nand together with my long following author\n<a href=\"https://vnhacker.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Duong Ngoc Thai</a> triggered the writing spirit in\nme, again. I named this &quot;to be continued&quot;, surely inspired from the &quot;on going&quot;\nof Tim Bray, to remind me that I can continue on it anytime.</p>\n","tags":["to-be-continued"]}}}
