I added a web feed to this blog with Atom Syndication Format. It's surprisingly
easy to implement using `preact-render-to-string`. Try adding
`https://ngxv.org/blog` to your feed reader to see the result.

If you are curious about how I implemented it,
[here](https://github.com/cavoirom/nxv/commit/e1664824ca9adfba57f58616c32be7bc3872b2b0#diff-7394924fe7405cc84cd750f2c2f4b721ccd606242dacc0cd611232b6a1af24c7)
is the hint.
