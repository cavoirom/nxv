It's been a long time since I first created a blog.

There was 2005 and Yahoo was a thing, the blog was on Yahoo! 360, a platform attracted young people share their
though on many topics, mostly personal teenager opinion. I'm one of them. Then came Facebook, people were crazy about how
connected they are on a social network, Facebook solved issues from the previous platforms such as image hosting,
messaging, commenting, notification and friend list. The "real" social in my country improved a lot with the coming of
Facebook, people's opinion raised and listened, there was some freedom of speech for a country needed it. I personally
felt missing Yahoo! 360 age, where we could share more personal things and wrote our though deeply.

Since then, I created a blog on Blogger, but I never felt comfortable on that platform, it could be my fault.

I recently found these guys ([Tim Bray](https://www.tbray.org), [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io),
[Jamie Zawinski](https://www.jwz.org)) and together with my long following author
[Duong Ngoc Thai](https://vnhacker.blogspot.com) triggered the writing spirit in me, again. I named this "to be
continued", surely inspired from the "on going" of Tim Bray, to remind me that I can continue on it anytime.
