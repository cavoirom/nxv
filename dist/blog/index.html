<p>There was 2005 and Yahoo was a thing, the blog was on Yahoo! 360, a platform attracted young people share their
though on many topics, mostly personal teenager opinion. I'm one of them. Then came Facebook, people were crazy about how
connected they are on a social network, Facebook solved issues from the previous platforms such as image hosting,
messaging, commenting, notification and friend list. The &quot;real&quot; social in my country improved a lot with the coming of
Facebook, people's opinion raised and listened, there was some freedom of speech for a country needed it. I personally
felt missing Yahoo! 360 age, where we could share more personal things and wrote our though deeply.</p>
<p>Since then, I created a blog on Blogger, but I never felt comfortable on that platform, it could be my fault.</p>
<p>I recently found these guys (<a href="https://www.tbray.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Tim Bray</a>, <a href="https://overreacted.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Dan Abramov</a>,
<a href="https://www.jwz.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Jamie Zawinski</a>) and together with my long following author
<a href="https://vnhacker.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Duong Ngoc Thai</a> triggered the writing spirit in me, again. I named this &quot;to be
continued&quot;, surely inspired from the &quot;on going&quot; of Tim Bray, to remind me that I can continue on it anytime.</p>
