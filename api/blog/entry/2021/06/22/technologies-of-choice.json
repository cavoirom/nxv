I tried to explain my opinion about\nevery piece of technology. Those are what I'm using every day.</p>\n<p>In any technology, <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>security</strong> are three\ntop focus points I would like to consider. I'm willing to give up convenience,\nbeautiful, feature rich to achieve some of those goals.</p>\n<h2>Platform</h2>\n<p>When I talk about a platform, I mean hardware and operating system in\ncombination to provide a base working environment.</p>\n<h3>Macbook M1 &amp; MacOS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily working environment.</li>\n<li>Good development environment and tools, consistent with other Unix-like\nsystem.</li>\n<li>Good GUI.</li>\n<li>Good built-in applications.</li>\n<li>Security done right.</li>\n<li>Good cloud integration.</li>\n<li>The best hardware and software integration.</li>\n<li>Very good performance.</li>\n<li>The best trackpad.</li>\n<li>Screen, keyboard, overall design are very good.</li>\n<li>Long batter duration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>VPS &amp; OpenBSD</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Server environment.</li>\n<li>No GUI, just text base interface.</li>\n<li>Security focused.</li>\n<li>Good old Unix tools.</li>\n<li>Good built-in applications: relayd, httpd, acme-client...</li>\n<li>Simple to manage and upgrade.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Daily usage</h2>\n<h3>Window Tiling · Amethyst / Yabai</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I needs these applications only for maximize the windows automatically, to\nfocus on single task at a time.</li>\n<li>Amethyst: easy to use.</li>\n<li>Yabai: flexible, more control.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Browser · Safari / Firefox / Chrome</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Safari: private use.</li>\n<li>Firefox / Chrome: development.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Apple Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal task management.</li>\n<li>Note taking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Apple Calendar</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Work meeting and schedule.</li>\n<li>Person schedule and sharing with family.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Apple Dictionary</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick lookup when writing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Password Manager · MacPass / Enpass</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enpass: only for my wife because it's easy to use and sync with iCloud.</li>\n<li>Macpass\n<ul>\n<li>KeePass format compatible.</li>\n<li>Native implementation for MacOS.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Development</h2>\n<p>I'm a Web Developer, I mostly work with Java back-end and Angular/React\nfront-end, I care about the Terminal and the performance of every tool that I\nuse. That's why you will see I tried to eliminate unnecessary complexity.</p>\n<h3>Monospace Font · Fira Code</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Monospace Font is very important because I'm looking at those character more\nthan 8 hours/day, on terminal, text editor, IDE...</li>\n<li>Very nice looking font.</li>\n<li>Support ligature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Apple Terminal</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Best built-in terminal.</li>\n<li>Don't trust me? Read <a href=\"https://danluu.com/term-latency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://danluu.com/term-latency/</a></li>\n<li>Low latency.</li>\n<li>Very good GUI.</li>\n<li>Just work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shell · zsh</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bash compatible. Use zsh, you don't need to learn Bash at work again.</li>\n<li>Work very well with: key-bindings.zsh (taken from oh-my-zsh project),\nzsh-autosuggestions, fzf.</li>\n<li>Say no to plugin frameworks, they will let you down.</li>\n<li>The final setup give me a fast shell, auto suggestions based on history,\nhistory fuzzy search.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SSH Agent · Sekey</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use built-in secure enclave to generate private/public key.</li>\n<li>The private key will never expose to any party.</li>\n<li>Use Touch ID for authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Source code version control system · git</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>VCS is not something I could choose, because it's based on the project I'm\nworking on. But I choose git whenever it's possible.</li>\n<li>Best of its kind.</li>\n<li>Best when using in shell.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Package Manager · MacPorts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Why <em>MacPorts</em>? Why not <em>Homebrew</em>? Because I'm old. I had worked with\n<em>Portage</em> on Gentoo, pacman on Archlinux. I found I'm home when I'm using\n<em>MacPorts</em>.</li>\n<li>Most of command line tools are available.</li>\n<li>Can build application from source code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Simple Text Editor · vim / Sublime Text</h3>\n<h4>vim</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>When working on shell.</li>\n<li>Very good key bindings and features.</li>\n<li>Keyboard focused.</li>\n<li>Power user focused.</li>\n<li>Built-in on most Unix-like system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Sublime Text</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nice trial software.</li>\n<li>Native implementation for MacOS.</li>\n<li>Good GUI.</li>\n<li>Good plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>IDE · IntelliJ and brothers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Best Java IDE.</li>\n<li>Premium user experience.</li>\n<li>Good plugins.</li>\n<li>Good performance despite being built on Java Platform.</li>\n<li>Why not Visual Studio Code? No thanks, the developers behind Visual Studio\nCode had done a great work, but I don't prefer WebApp when it's an application\nwhich I use everyday, every millisecond matter.</li>\n</ul>\n","tags":["hardware","macbook","macos","openbsd","platform","software"]}
